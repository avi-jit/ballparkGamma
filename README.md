BallPark is an interactive game that challenges players to arrange cards with numerical values on a number line based on their corresponding facts.

## Gameplay
BallPark presents players with a set of cards, each containing a fact and its corresponding numerical value. The goal is to arrange the cards on a number line based on their numerical values. Players must use their logical reasoning and estimation skills to correctly order the cards.

To arrange the cards, follow these steps:

Drag a card from the bottom panel and place it on the number line at the desired position.

Release the card to lock it in place.

Repeat the above steps for the remaining cards until all of them are correctly placed on the number line.

Once you are satisfied with your arrangement, submit your answer to see how close you were to the correct order.

## Modes
BallPark offers three different modes to cater to different preferences and requirements:

Single Player
In Single Player mode, you can challenge yourself by solving card arrangement puzzles individually. The game will provide you with a set of cards, and you have to arrange them on the number line. You have three lives, and each time you arrange the cards incorrectly, you lose one life. If you lose all three lives, the game ends. The objective is to achieve the highest score possible by arranging the cards correctly with the fewest mistakes.

Multiplayer
Multiplayer mode allows you to compete with your friends or other online players. Create a room and share the unique room code with others to invite them to join. Each player will receive the same set of cards, and the player who arranges them in the correct order in the shortest time wins the round. In this mode, you also have three lives, and each incorrect arrangement results in the loss of one life. The player with the highest score after a certain number of rounds or the first to reach a certain score threshold wins the game.

Study Mode
Study Mode is designed for players who want to practice card arrangement without any time pressure. You can access this mode to refine your skills, experiment with different strategies, or simply enjoy the game at your own pace. This mode does not include lives, so you can freely rearrange the cards until you are satisfied with the result.

## Scoring and Lives
In Single Player and Multiplayer modes, you earn points based on your performance. The scoring system takes into account the number of correctly arranged cards, the time taken to complete the task, and the number of lives remaining. The faster you arrange the cards correctly with fewer mistakes, the higher your score will be.

Remember, in Single Player and Multiplayer modes, you start with three lives. Each time you arrange the cards incorrectly, you lose one life. If you run out of lives, the game ends. Use your lives wisely and try to minimize mistakes to achieve the highest possible score.
